How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this project has given me a few skills that will help me create better projects in the future. Although this project is in need of some TLC it has shown me that I need to have patience and should not rush things as that can lead to getting lost in your work and becoming stuck. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I tried to take things one step at a time, but somewhere along this path I got stuck trying to figure out one problem and creating more along the way. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I would need to improve my focus and actually work on one thing at once rather than trying to do multiple things at a time.


How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
In the future I should clearly define the goals and objectives I want for my 3D scene. Studing objects in the scene and trying to understand the lighting, composition, textures, and other elements that will contribute to the desired outcome helps. Being able to correclty apply appropriate textures and materials to your 3D models to enhance realism and visual appeal.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration is an important aspect of the development process. Here we were able to use the feedback from our professor and make any necessary changes or improvements on our assingments.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
While going through the milestones I was able to add a few things here and there, but when it came down to the finished project I fell short from my completed scene.
